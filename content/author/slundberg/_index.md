I am a PhD candidate in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) working with [Su-In Lee](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu). My research focuses on explainable artificial intelligence and its application to problems in medicine and healthcare. This has led to the development of broadly applicable [methods and tools](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) for interpreting complex machine learning models that are now used in banking, logistics, sports, manufacturing, cloud services, economics, and many other areas.
